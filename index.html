          <h2 class="student-name">Student</h2>
          <p>
            As an Information Technology student, I have developed a strong
            foundation in various fields, such as computer programming, database
            management, networking, and cybersecurity. I am keenly interested in
            exploring emerging technologies and their potential applications in
            real-world scenarios. I am well-versed in various programming
            languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I have experience
            working with databases such as MySQL and Oracle. Additionally, I am
            familiar with network protocols and security best practices. As a
            proactive learner, I constantly seek new opportunities to expand my
            skill set and apply my knowledge in practical settings. I am a team
            player and possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills,
            which enable me to collaborate effectively with colleagues and
            stakeholders.
